## TEST 5: Career Progression - Hierarchical

**Question:** Analyze the career progression patterns from entry-level to senior positions across different industries

**Description:** Test recursive retrieval for hierarchical career analysis

**Expected Topics:** career, progression, entry-level, senior, industries

**Expected Strategy:** recursive

**Query Type:** hierarchical

**Response:**
```
Career progression patterns from entry-level to senior positions typically follow a structured path that varies by industry but often includes several common stages. 

1. **Entry-Level Positions**: Individuals usually start in roles that require minimal experience, such as interns or junior staff. These positions focus on skill development and gaining practical experience. For example, in engineering, a new graduate might begin as a production engineer, while in supply chain management, they might start as a procurement assistant.

2. **Mid-Level Positions**: After gaining experience (typically 3-5 years), professionals often move into mid-level roles. These positions involve more responsibility, such as managing projects or leading small teams. For instance, a production engineer may advance to a senior engineer role, while someone in supply chain might become a supply chain planner.

3. **Senior Positions**: With further experience (5-10 years), individuals can transition into senior roles, which often include strategic decision-making and leadership responsibilities. In engineering, this could mean becoming a lead engineer or project manager, while in administration, one might take on the role of an administrative officer or manager.

4. **Executive Roles**: The final stage in career progression is often reaching executive or senior management positions. This requires extensive experience and a proven track record of leadership. Professionals may become department heads, directors, or even C-suite executives, depending on their industry.

Throughout this progression, continuous learning, networking, and skill enhancement are crucial for advancement. Each industry may have specific requirements or pathways, but the general trajectory remains similar across sectors.
