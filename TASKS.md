- [x] Enhanced `_generate_natural_response()` method to include related locations section with Google Maps links
- [x] Enhanced `_show_rag_sources()` method to include location hierarchy and Google Maps URLs
- [x] Added `_extract_location_info()` helper method to extract and format location data from metadata
- [x] Added `_collect_unique_locations()` helper method to gather top 3 unique locations for related locations section
- [x] Implemented Google Maps URL generation from coordinates when direct URL not available
- [x] Added emoji indicators (üìç for location, üó∫Ô∏è for Maps link) as specified in PRD
- [x] Enhanced query execution header with üîç emoji indicator
- [x] Added comprehensive unit tests for new location display functionality (13 tests passing)
- [x] Verified Google Maps links work correctly and display properly
- [x] Tested coordinate fallback mechanism when Maps URL unavailable
- [x] Tested Unicode emoji compatibility with Thai characters
- [x] Verified graceful handling of missing location data
- [x] Created demo script showcasing all new location features
- [x] Verified implementation works with sample data through demo
- [x] Performance testing shows no degradation in query response time
- [x] **NEW: Added primary location extraction from top document for mapping integration**
- [x] **NEW: Enhanced natural language response to include coordinates and Maps link from top result**
- [x] **NEW: Added `_extract_primary_location_json()` method for easy backend integration**
- [x] **NEW: Updated `execute_query()` to return location data with query results**
- [x] **NEW: Added JSON-formatted location data for mapping backend consumption**
- [x] **NEW: Extended unit tests to cover mapping integration features (14 tests total)**
- [x] **ENHANCED: Primary location now displays coordinates inline for mapping app integration**
- [x] **ENHANCED: Created comprehensive mapping integration demo script**
- [x] **ENHANCED: All 14 unit tests passing successfully**

## In Progress Tasks
- [ ] User acceptance testing for display clarity and readability

## Upcoming Tasks
- [ ] Documentation update reflecting new location and mapping integration features

## Implementation Summary

The Google Maps Location Integration feature has been successfully implemented with the following enhancements:

### ‚úÖ Core Features Implemented
1. **Location Information Display**: All query results now show location hierarchy (Province > District > Subdistrict)
2. **Google Maps Integration**: Clickable Google Maps URLs displayed with üó∫Ô∏è emoji indicator
3. **Coordinate Fallback**: When Maps URL unavailable, coordinates are displayed and URLs generated automatically
4. **Related Locations Section**: Natural language responses include top 3 unique locations with Maps links
5. **Enhanced RAG Sources**: Source documents show complete location information
6. **üÜï Primary Location Integration**: Natural language responses now include primary location coordinates from top document
7. **üÜï Mapping Backend Support**: JSON-formatted location data for easy integration with mapping applications

### ‚úÖ Technical Implementation
- Modified `cli_operations.py` with 5 new methods and enhanced 4 existing methods
- Added robust error handling for missing or incomplete location data
- Implemented Unicode Thai character support
- Created comprehensive unit test suite with 13 test cases
- All tests passing successfully
- **NEW**: Added mapping integration methods for backend consumption
- **ENHANCED**: Primary location coordinates now displayed inline with location name

### ‚úÖ User Experience Improvements
- Clear visual indicators with emojis (üìç for location, üó∫Ô∏è for Maps, üîç for query)
- Hierarchical location display format
- Graceful degradation when location data is incomplete
- Clickable Google Maps URLs for easy navigation
- **NEW**: Primary location coordinates displayed inline in natural language responses (e.g., "üìç Primary Location: Chai Nat, Noen Kham (14.967, 99.907)")
- **NEW**: JSON location data format for programmatic access by mapping applications

### ‚úÖ Quality Assurance
- No performance degradation in query response time
- Full backward compatibility maintained
- Robust handling of edge cases (missing data, partial metadata)
- Demo script created for feature showcase
- **NEW**: Extended test coverage for mapping integration features (14 tests total, all passing)

### üó∫Ô∏è **NEW: Mapping Integration Features**

The implementation now provides enhanced support for mapping applications:

1. **Primary Location Extraction**: Automatically extracts latitude/longitude from the top search result
2. **JSON Format**: Provides location data in structured JSON format for easy backend consumption:
   ```json
   {
     "location": {
       "latitude": 18.7883,
       "longitude": 98.9853,
       "display": "‡πÄ‡∏ä‡∏µ‡∏¢‡∏á‡πÉ‡∏´‡∏°‡πà, ‡πÄ‡∏°‡∏∑‡∏≠‡∏á‡πÄ‡∏ä‡∏µ‡∏¢‡∏á‡πÉ‡∏´‡∏°‡πà, ‡∏®‡∏£‡∏µ‡∏†‡∏π‡∏°‡∏¥",
       "province": "‡πÄ‡∏ä‡∏µ‡∏¢‡∏á‡πÉ‡∏´‡∏°‡πà",
       "district": "‡πÄ‡∏°‡∏∑‡∏≠‡∏á‡πÄ‡∏ä‡∏µ‡∏¢‡∏á‡πÉ‡∏´‡∏°‡πà",
       "subdistrict": "‡∏®‡∏£‡∏µ‡∏†‡∏π‡∏°‡∏¥",
       "maps_url": "https://maps.google.com/maps?q=18.7883,98.9853",
       "coordinates_formatted": "18.788300, 98.985300"
     }
   }
   ```
3. **Enhanced Natural Responses**: Each natural language response now includes primary location information
4. **Query Result Integration**: Location data is embedded in query results for programmatic access

The implementation fully satisfies all requirements specified in PRD-11 and the additional mapping integration requirements, following the coding rules guidelines.
