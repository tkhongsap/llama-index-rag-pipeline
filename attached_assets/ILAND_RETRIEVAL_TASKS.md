## Implementation Notes

### Thai Language Considerations
- All adapters support Thai text input and processing
- Metadata adapter recognizes Thai province names and land deed types
- Hybrid adapter extracts Thai keywords using Unicode range detection
- Query planner decomposes complex Thai land deed queries

### Strategy Selection Logic
- Geographic queries (จังหวัด, อำเภอ) → Metadata strategy
- Land deed type queries (โฉนด, นส.3) → Hybrid strategy  
- Simple semantic queries → Vector strategy
- Complex multi-step queries → Planner strategy

### Performance Considerations
- Vector strategy prioritized for reliability and speed
- Heuristic fallbacks ensure system always returns results
- Round-robin mode available for testing and comparison
- Detailed logging for performance analysis

### Integration Points
- Uses existing iLand embedding loading utilities
- Mirrors src/agentic_retriever architecture patterns
- Compatible with existing logging and statistics systems
- Follows established coding patterns and conventions

## Next Steps

1. **Test with Real Data**: Load actual iLand embeddings and validate all components
2. **Performance Tuning**: Benchmark strategies and optimize for Thai content
3. **Advanced Features**: Add pythainlp integration and additional indices
4. **Production Deployment**: Add comprehensive testing and deployment procedures

## Success Criteria

- [x] All seven strategy adapters implemented and functional
