## TEST 5: Career Progression - Hierarchical

**Question:** Analyze the career progression patterns from entry-level to senior positions across different industries

**Description:** Test recursive retrieval for hierarchical career analysis

**Expected Topics:** career, progression, entry-level, senior, industries

**Expected Strategy:** recursive

**Query Type:** hierarchical

**Response:**
```
Career progression patterns from entry-level to senior positions typically follow a structured path that varies by industry but often includes several common stages. 

1. **Entry-Level Positions**: Individuals usually start in roles that require minimal experience, such as interns or junior staff. These positions focus on foundational skills and knowledge relevant to the industry. For example, in engineering, a new graduate might begin as a production engineer, while in supply chain management, they might start as a procurement assistant.

2. **Mid-Level Positions**: After gaining experience (typically 3-5 years), professionals often transition to mid-level roles. These positions involve more responsibility, such as managing projects or leading small teams. For instance, a production engineer may advance to a senior engineer role, while someone in logistics might become a supply chain planner.

3. **Senior Positions**: With further experience (5-10 years), individuals can move into senior roles, which often include strategic decision-making and leadership responsibilities. In engineering, this could mean becoming a lead engineer or project manager, while in administration, one might advance to an administrative officer or manager.

4. **Executive Roles**: The final stage in career progression is often reaching executive or senior management positions. This typically requires extensive experience (10+ years) and a proven track record of leadership and strategic impact. Roles such as director or vice president are common in this stage.

Throughout these stages, continuous professional development, networking, and sometimes further education play crucial roles in facilitating upward mobility. Each industry may have specific nuances in terms of required skills and typical timelines for advancement, but the overall trajectory remains similar across sectors.

## TEST 8: Industry Comparison - Hybrid

**Question:** Compare the 'Manufacturing' industry compensation with 'Oil' industry for similar experience levels

**Description:** Test hybrid retrieval for exact industry matching with semantic comparison

**Expected Topics:** manufacturing, oil, industry, compensation, experience

**Expected Strategy:** hybrid

**Query Type:** hybrid

**Response:**
```
Compensation in the 'Manufacturing' industry and the 'Oil' industry can vary significantly based on factors such as job roles, experience levels, and specific company practices. Generally, professionals in the 'Oil' industry tend to receive higher compensation packages compared to those in the 'Manufacturing' sector, particularly for similar experience levels. This difference can be attributed to the higher revenue potential and profitability associated with oil extraction and production, as well as the specialized skills required in the oil sector. 

For individuals with 5-10 years of experience, roles in the 'Oil' industry, such as engineers or technical specialists, may offer more lucrative salaries and benefits compared to equivalent positions in 'Manufacturing', such as production engineers. However, specific compensation figures would depend on the exact job roles and the companies involved.

## TEST 9: Complex Analysis - Planning

**Question:** First identify the top 3 industries by candidate count, then analyze their average compensation, and finally compare their educational requirements

**Description:** Test query planning for multi-step analysis

**Expected Topics:** top industries, candidate count, average compensation, educational requirements

**Expected Strategy:** planner

**Query Type:** multi-step

**Response:**
```
The top three industries by candidate count are **Customer Service**, **Marketing**, and **Engineering**. 

In terms of average compensation, specific figures are not available, which limits the ability to analyze or compare the financial aspects of these industries.

Regarding educational requirements:
- **Customer Service** positions often require at least a high school diploma, with some roles preferring candidates with associate or bachelor's degrees in fields like business or communications.
- **Marketing** typically requires a bachelor's degree in marketing, business administration, or a related field, with advanced positions possibly needing a master's degree or specialized certifications.
- **Engineering** generally necessitates a bachelor's degree in engineering or a related technical field, with advanced roles often requiring a master's degree or professional engineering licensure.

In summary, while the candidate counts are clear, the lack of compensation data is a limitation, and the educational requirements show a trend towards higher education across all three industries, with specific degree preferences reflecting their operational needs.

## TEST 10: Regional Analysis - Planning

**Question:** Determine which provinces have the highest concentration of candidates, analyze their job families, and identify compensation trends by region

**Description:** Test query planning for complex regional analysis

**Expected Topics:** provinces, concentration, job families, compensation trends, region

**Expected Strategy:** planner

**Query Type:** multi-step

**Response:**
```
The provinces of **ปทุมธานี** and **พิษณุโลก** are noted for having candidate profiles, but specific data on the number of candidates in each province is lacking, making it difficult to determine which has the highest concentration. Additionally, there is insufficient information to analyze the job families represented by candidates in these provinces, as well as to identify compensation trends. 

Factors that could influence candidate concentration and compensation trends include economic conditions, industry presence, educational institutions, cost of living, job market demand, government policies, migration patterns, and the strength of professional networks. However, without detailed data, a comprehensive analysis of job families and compensation levels in these regions cannot be conducted at this time. Further research is needed to gather the necessary information for a more thorough understanding.
