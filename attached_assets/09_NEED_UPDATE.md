# PRD 2: Metadata Indices for Fast Filtering of 50k Documents

## 1. Overview
Implement efficient metadata indexing that enables rapid filtering before vector search, significantly improving query performance for document attributes like location, deed type, and area size.

## 2. Problem Statement
When scaling to 50k documents, vector-only search becomes inefficient for attribute-specific queries. With no way to pre-filter by metadata, every query must process the entire collection, leading to degraded performance and precision.

## 3. Goals & Success Metrics
- **Primary Goal**: Achieve sub-50ms response time for filtered queries on 50k documents
- **Secondary Goals**:
  - Support complex filtering combinations (location + deed type + size range)
  - Reduce compute resources required for filtering by 80%
- **Success Metrics**:
  - 100% accuracy for exact metadata matches
  - >90% reduction in documents processed post-filtering
  - Index size <10% of total vector store size

## 4. User Requirements
- Support fast filtering by province, district, deed type, etc.
- Enable numeric range queries (e.g., area between 5-10 rai)
- Combine metadata filters with semantic search
- Allow multiple filter conditions

## 5. Functional Requirements
- Create inverted indices for categorical fields (deed type, province, district)
- Implement B-tree indices for numeric fields (area size, coordinates)
- Support ranged queries with efficient pruning
- Enable compound filtering with AND/OR logic
- Provide metadata statistics for filtering optimization

## 6. Technical Design
- Schema definition for metadata fields with type information
- In-memory index with disk persistence
- Index-aware retriever implementation
- Query planning and optimization
- Incremental index updates

## 7. Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Metadata Schema & Indexing
```python
class MetadataIndexManager:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize indices
        self.keyword_indices = {}  # field -> value -> doc_ids
        self.numeric_indices = {}  # field -> sorted [(value, doc_id)]
        
    def index_document(self, doc_id, metadata):
        # Index each field
        for field, value in metadata.items():
            if isinstance(value, (int, float)):
                self._index_numeric(field, value, doc_id)
            else:
                self._index_keyword(field, str(value), doc_id)
    
    def query(self, filters):
        # Process filters and return matching document IDs
        # Implementation with filter optimization
```

### Phase 2: Integration with Vector Store
- Implement pre-filtering before vector search
- Create hybrid retriever
- Add query optimization
