These positions are foundational and focus on skill acquisition and understanding industry dynamics. For example, roles such as Production Engineer in the engineering sector or positions in supply chain and logistics are common starting points.

2. **Mid-Career Advancement**: As professionals gain experience (usually around 3-5 years), they often transition into more specialized roles or supervisory positions. This phase may involve moving from roles like Purchasing/Buyer in supply chain to more strategic positions such as Supply Chain Planner. The age range for mid-career professionals is generally 28-34.

3. **Senior-Level Positions**: With 5-10 years of experience, individuals often reach senior roles, which may include managerial or executive positions. For instance, professionals may advance to roles such as Administrative Officer or higher management in various sectors, including administration and engineering. This stage typically involves greater responsibility, leadership, and strategic decision-making.

4. **Industry-Specific Trends**: Different industries may have unique pathways. For example, in engineering, the progression might be more technical, while in administration, it could focus on operational management. The transition from technical roles to managerial positions is also common, reflecting a shift from hands-on work to strategic oversight.

5. **Geographic Influence**: The location can impact career progression, with professionals in urban areas often having access to more opportunities and resources for advancement compared to those in rural regions.

Overall, the career trajectory from entry-level to senior positions is characterized by increasing responsibility, specialization, and leadership roles, influenced by industry norms and geographic factors.

**Description:** Test hybrid retrieval for exact industry matching with semantic comparison

**Expected Topics:** manufacturing, oil, industry, compensation, experience

**Expected Strategy:** hybrid

**Query Type:** hybrid

**Response:**
```
Compensation in the 'Manufacturing' industry and the 'Oil' industry can vary significantly based on factors such as job roles, experience levels, and specific company practices. Generally, professionals in the 'Oil' industry tend to receive higher compensation packages compared to those in the 'Manufacturing' sector, particularly for similar experience levels. This difference can be attributed to the higher profit margins and specialized skills required in the oil sector, which often leads to more competitive salaries and benefits. 

For individuals with 5-10 years of experience, roles in the 'Oil' industry, such as engineering positions, may offer additional incentives, bonuses, and benefits that are less common in the 'Manufacturing' industry. However, specific compensation figures would depend on the exact job roles and the companies involved.

## TEST 9: Complex Analysis - Planning

**Question:** First identify the top 3 industries by candidate count, then analyze their average compensation, and finally compare their educational requirements

**Description:** Test query planning for multi-step analysis

**Expected Topics:** top industries, candidate count, average compensation, educational requirements

**Expected Strategy:** planner

**Query Type:** multi-step

**Response:**
```
The top three industries by candidate count are:

1. **Customer Service**
2. **Marketing**
3. **Engineering**

Unfortunately, specific average compensation figures for these industries are not available, which limits the analysis of financial aspects related to these roles.

Regarding educational requirements:

- **Customer Service**: Typically requires a high school diploma or equivalent for entry-level positions, though some roles may prefer candidates with an associate's or bachelor's degree, especially for management positions.
  
- **Marketing**: Generally requires a bachelor's degree in marketing, business, or a related field. Advanced degrees, such as an MBA with a focus on marketing, may be preferred for higher-level positions.
  
- **Engineering**: Usually necessitates a bachelor's degree in engineering or a related field. For specialized roles, advanced degrees or professional engineering licenses may be required.

In summary, while the top three industries have been identified, the lack of compensation data prevents a thorough financial analysis. The educational requirements show that Customer Service has lower entry-level requirements compared to Marketing and Engineering, which typically require a bachelor's degree, with Engineering often needing further qualifications for specialized roles.

## TEST 10: Regional Analysis - Planning

**Question:** Determine which provinces have the highest concentration of candidates, analyze their job families, and identify compensation trends by region

**Description:** Test query planning for complex regional analysis

**Expected Topics:** provinces, concentration, job families, compensation trends, region

**Expected Strategy:** planner

**Query Type:** multi-step

**Response:**
```
The provinces identified with notable candidate profiles are **ปทุมธานี** and **พิษณุโลก**. However, specific data on the number of candidates in each province is lacking, making it difficult to determine which has the highest concentration.

Regarding job families, there is insufficient information to analyze the specific job families represented by candidates in these provinces. A more detailed examination of individual profiles would be necessary to identify prevalent job families.

Compensation trends by region are also not clearly defined due to the absence of aggregated salary data for different job families in each province. While individual profiles may contain salary information, a comprehensive analysis is not possible with the current dataset. It is noted that compensation can vary significantly based on local economic conditions, demand for skills, and cost of living, which influences salary ranges across different regions.

In summary, while **ปทุมธานี** and **พิษณุโลก** are recognized for having candidate profiles, further data collection is needed to accurately assess candidate concentration, job families, and compensation trends in these provinces.
