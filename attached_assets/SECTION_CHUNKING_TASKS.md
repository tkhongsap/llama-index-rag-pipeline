# Section-Based Chunking Implementation for Land Deed Documents

Implementation of section-based chunking strategy for structured Thai land deed documents to scale to 50k documents efficiently.

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Analyzed existing codebase and chunking patterns
- [x] Reviewed @08_section_based_chunking.md recommendations
- [x] Created implementation task list

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Create LandDeedSectionParser that extends existing DocumentProcessor
- [x] Add section-based node parsing to embedding pipeline  
- [x] Implement metadata filtering for 50k document scalability
- [x] Update retrieval strategies to use section-aware chunking
- [x] Create demo script to test section-based chunking
- [x] Test and validate section-based chunking concept
- [x] Resolve import issues and create working demo
- [x] Demonstrate complete section-based workflow

## Ready for Production Integration
- [ ] Integrate working demo with existing batch embedding pipeline
- [ ] Replace mock embeddings with real OpenAI API calls
- [ ] Test with actual land deed dataset (scaled approach)
- [ ] Monitor performance metrics and chunk size optimization
- [ ] Deploy to production environment for 50k document processing

## Future Enhancements
- [ ] Create specialized indices for common query types (location, deed info, area)
- [ ] Add advanced query routing with ML-based section detection
- [ ] Implement adaptive chunk sizing based on content density
- [ ] Add performance monitoring dashboard
- [ ] Integration with existing agentic retriever framework

## Implementation Details

### Current Architecture
- **DocumentProcessor**: Already creates structured documents with sections
- **Embedding Pipeline**: Uses standard chunking with SentenceSplitter
- **Retrieval**: Multiple strategies but no section-awareness

### Target Architecture
- **LandDeedSectionParser**: Section-aware chunking with 512 token chunks
- **Enhanced Metadata**: Rich section-based metadata for filtering
- **Specialized Indices**: Location, deed info, and full indices for efficient retrieval
- **Query Routing**: Intelligent routing based on query content

### Key Changes Needed
1. Extend DocumentProcessor with section parsing capabilities
2. Update embedding pipeline to use section-based chunking
3. Add metadata filtering before vector search
4. Create specialized retrieval strategies per section type
